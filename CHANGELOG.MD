# Math Problem Generator - Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **API Routes Implementation**
  - **Problem Generation** (`app/api/math-problem/route.ts`) - Dedicated endpoint for AI-powered math problem generation
  - **Answer Submission** (`app/api/math-problem/submit/route.ts`) - Separate endpoint for answer submission and AI feedback
  - Both endpoints use Google Gemini 2.0 Flash model with comprehensive error handling

### Technical Details
- **AI Integration**: Used Google Gemini 2.0 Flash model for problem generation and feedback (updated from deprecated gemini-pro)
- **Database Operations**: Integrated with Supabase for persistent storage of problems and submissions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with custom interfaces for API requests/responses
- **Code Comments**: Extensive comments explaining every decision and approach for future reference

### Fixed
- **API Model Compatibility** - Updated from deprecated `gemini-pro` to `gemini-2.0-flash` model
  - Fixed 404 error when generating math problems
  - Ensures compatibility with current Google AI API
  - Maintains same functionality with updated model

- **API Route Structure** - Restructured API endpoints for proper Next.js App Router support
  - Fixed 404 error when submitting answers
  - Created separate `/api/math-problem/submit/route.ts` for answer submission
  - Simplified `/api/math-problem/route.ts` to handle only problem generation
  - Follows Next.js App Router best practices for multiple operations

- **AI Integration Issues** - Added comprehensive debugging and improved JSON parsing
  - Added detailed logging to see raw AI responses for troubleshooting
  - Enhanced JSON parsing to handle markdown code blocks and mixed content
  - Improved AI prompt with explicit JSON format requirements
  - Added fallback problem system when AI fails completely

- **Tailwind CSS Configuration** - Fixed styling issues with proper Tailwind setup
  - Replaced `globals.css` with proper Tailwind directives and imports
  - Added `postcss.config.js` for PostCSS and Autoprefixer configuration
  - Added `tailwind.config.js` with proper content paths for all components
  - Fixed error display styling with functional Tailwind utility classes

### Added
- **Hint System** - AI-generated hints for student assistance
  - Added `hint` column to `math_problem_sessions` database table
  - Updated AI prompt to generate simple, contextual hints with each problem
  - Implemented hint state management and toggle UI component
  - Hint button appears only when AI provides a hint (graceful degradation)
  - Yellow/gold themed hint display for visual differentiation
  - Hint visibility resets when generating new problem, persists after submission
  - Updated TypeScript types across database schema, API routes, and frontend

### Fixed
- **Hint Display Bug** - Fixed hint not appearing in frontend
  - Added hint field to API response payload (was only saved to database)
  - Hint now properly passed from backend to frontend for display

- **AI Problem Variety** - Enhanced prompt to generate diverse, creative problems
  - Added explicit variety requirements (diverse scenarios, operations, names)
  - Included multiple example problems to guide AI toward creativity
  - Specified 10+ scenario themes (sports, cooking, animals, school, games, etc.)
  - Instructed AI to avoid repetitive patterns and common names
  - Improved problem diversity and engagement for students

- **UX Improvements** - Enhanced error handling and user feedback
  - Added error state management for API failure notifications
  - Implemented user-friendly error messages instead of silent failures
  - Added error display with minimal styling (red-bordered message box)
  - Clear error messages on successful operations for better user experience

### Added
- **Frontend Logic Implementation** (`app/page.tsx`)
  - Implemented `generateProblem()` function with comprehensive error handling
  - Implemented `submitAnswer()` function with form validation and state management
  - Added detailed comments explaining every decision and approach
  - Integrated loading states and user feedback mechanisms

### Features Implemented
- ✅ AI generates appropriate Primary 5 level math problems
- ✅ Problems and answers are saved to Supabase database
- ✅ User submissions are saved with AI-generated feedback
- ✅ AI generates helpful, personalized feedback based on correctness
- ✅ UI is clean and mobile-responsive (existing)
- ✅ Error handling for API failures
- ✅ Loading states during API calls

## [Initial Setup]
- Project scaffolding with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase, and Google Generative AI
- Database schema with `math_problem_sessions` and `math_problem_submissions` tables
- Frontend UI with responsive design and proper state management
